# DocWise AI - Interview Questions & Answers

## Project Overview Questions

### Q1: Can you walk me through your DocWise AI project?

**Answer:**
DocWise AI is an advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system I built that allows users to upload documents and have intelligent conversations with them. The system processes PDFs, DOCX, and TXT files, creates vector embeddings, and uses AI to answer questions with source citations.

**Key Components:**

- React frontend with WhatsApp-style UI
- Flask backend with RESTful APIs
- LangChain for document processing and AI orchestration
- FAISS vector database for similarity search
- Groq API for chat completions
- Ollama for embeddings

The system features document management, real-time chat, analytics dashboard, and session persistence.

### Q2: What problem does this project solve?

**Answer:**
Traditional document search is keyword-based and often misses context. DocWise AI solves several problems:

1. **Semantic Understanding**: Users can ask natural language questions instead of keyword searches
2. **Source Attribution**: Every answer includes citations from source documents
3. **Multi-Document Analysis**: Compare and analyze information across multiple documents
4. **Accessibility**: WhatsApp-style interface makes AI approachable for non-technical users
5. **Efficiency**: Quickly extract insights from large document collections

**Real-world applications**: Legal document analysis, research assistance, corporate knowledge bases, academic paper review.

## Behavioral Questions

### Q16: What was the most challenging part of this project?

**Answer:**
The most challenging aspect was implementing the RAG pipeline efficiently while maintaining response quality.

**Specific Challenge:**
Initially, my chunking strategy was too simplistic, leading to context loss and poor response quality. Users were getting fragmented answers that didn't capture the full context of their questions.

**Solution Process:**

1. **Research**: Studied different chunking strategies and overlap techniques
2. **Experimentation**: Tested various chunk sizes (500, 1000, 1500 chars)
3. **Implementation**: Added 200-character overlap and metadata preservation
4. **Validation**: Implemented confidence scoring to measure improvement

**Result:**
Response quality improved by ~40% based on user feedback, and the system now provides more coherent, contextually accurate answers.

**Learning:**
This taught me the importance of iterative development and user feedback in AI systems. Performance metrics alone don't capture user experience quality.

```python
def debug_rag_response(query, document_id):
    # Step 1: Check retrieval
    retrieved_docs = vector_db.similarity_search(query, k=10)
    print(f"Retrieved {len(retrieved_docs)} documents")
  
    # Step 2: Analyze similarity scores
    for i, doc in enumerate(retrieved_docs):
        score = calculate_similarity(query, doc.content)
        print(f"Doc {i}: Score {score:.3f}")
  
    # Step 3: Check context quality
    context = format_context(retrieved_docs[:5])
    print(f"Context length: {len(context)} chars")
  
    # Step 4: Test with different parameters
    response = llm.generate(query, context, temperature=0.1)
    return response
```

**4. Resolution Steps:**

- Adjust retrieval parameters (k, similarity threshold)
- Improve document chunking strategy
